# Goal 
Recreate a lot of what I like with LazyVim but from scratch, gain a deeper understanding of how it all works together.

## Plugins
1. **Searching**
    1. `telescope` - Quick searching with `fzf` and `rg`.
    2. `flash` - Sets it up for tag based searching. 
2. **Language Support**
    1. `conform` - Sets it up to enable a quick format based on a specified formatter (*such as `stylua` for lua files*.).
    2. `nvim-md` - Adds simple markdown syntax insertion support, see the keymaps for more information.
    3. `mason`, `mason-lspconfig`, `nvim-lspconfig` - Sets up all of the LSPs I generally use.
3. **General**
    1. `kanagawa` - Color Scheme of choice.
    2. `neo-tree` - UI for file explorer to replace `netrw`. 
    3. `which-key` - Major help figuring out and remembering key-binds!
